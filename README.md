# pandas_hw_pycity
This homework assignment for Pandas focused on showcasing the trends in different schools. I applied the groupby, sorting, and binning methods in order to aggregate data for:
1. District Summary
2. School Summary
3. Top & Performing Schools
4. Math & Reading scores by Grade
5. Scores by School Spending, School Size, & School Type
